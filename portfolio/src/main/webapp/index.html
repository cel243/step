                <p>I'm Caroline and this is my portfolio! A bit about me: I'm
                    currently a rising Junior at Cornell's College of
                    Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. On campus, I
                    sing in the University Chorus and I also work as a TA
                    for CS 2800: Discrete Math, one of my favorite courses
                    I've taken at Cornell. My interests outside CS include
                    Music and Linguistics, but I've known I wanted to study
                    Computer Science ever since I received my first
                    programmable calculator in middle school! Since
                    beginning my degree, I've taken many fascinating classes
                    in many areas of the field, including Natural Language
                    Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Smartphone
                    Computing Tech, Functional Programming, Data Structures,
                    and more! I've loved them all, but I have a special
                    place in my heart for theory classes like Algorithms.
                    It's hard to say whether I have a favorite field within
                    CS, since I'm still exploring and learning about new
                    career paths and options, but I've had a great time so
                    far working with robotics, data management, machine
                    learning, and software engineering, and I can't wait to
                    see what more I'll learn during this internship!

                    <p>I'm Caroline and this is my portfolio! A bit about me: 
                       I'm currently a rising Junior at Cornell's College of
                        Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. On campus, I
                        sing in the University Chorus and I also work as a TA
                        for CS 2800: Discrete Math, one of my favorite courses
                        I've taken at Cornell. My interests outside CS include
                        Music and Linguistics, but I've known I wanted to study
                        Computer Science ever since I received my first
                        programmable calculator in middle school! Since
                        beginning my degree, I've taken many fascinating classes
                        in many areas of the field, including Natural Language
                        Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Smartphone
                        Computing Tech, Functional Programming, Data Structures,
                        and more! I've loved them all, but I have a special
                        place in my heart for theory classes like Algorithms.
                        It's hard to say whether I have a favorite field within
                        CS, since I'm still exploring and learning about new
                        career paths and options, but I've had a great time so
                        far working with robotics, data management, machine
                        learning, and software engineering, and I can't wait to
                        see what more I'll learn during this internship!

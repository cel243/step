				<p>I'm Caroline and this is my portfolio! A bit about me: I'm
					currently a rising Junior at Cornell's College of
					Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. On campus, I
					sing in the University Chorus and I also work as a TA
					for CS 2800: Discrete Math, one of my favorite courses
					I've taken at Cornell. My interests outside CS include
					Music and Linguistics, but I've known I wanted to study
					Computer Science ever since I received my first
					programmable calculator in middle school! Since
					beginning my degree, I've taken many fascinating classes
					in many areas of the field, including Natural Language
					Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Smartphone
					Computing Tech, Functional Programming, Data Structures,
					and more! I've loved them all, but I have a special
					place in my heart for theory classes like Algorithms.
					It's hard to say whether I have a favorite field within
					CS, since I'm still exploring and learning about new
					career paths and options, but I've had a great time so
					far working with robotics, data management, machine
					learning, and software engineering, and I can't wait to
					see what more I'll learn during this internship!

        <u1>
            <li><b>Story Cloze Test Commonsense Reasoning Classifier</b>: A 
                feature-based Feedforward Neural Net that achieved 76.74% 
                accuracy at predicting the correct ending of a 4-sentence story 
                from the ROCStories corpus. </li>
            <li><b>Terminal-Based Chess with AI Player</b>: A chess game based 
                in the terminal. Select whether to play a human or computer 
                player, and whether to play a single round or tournament-style 
                game. Game features include saving and loading games, player 
                support features to enhace gameplay (displaying which pieces 
                are currently under attack, which pieces a player can capture, 
                etc.), AI-suggested moves, maintaining a move log, and more! 
                See my GitHub to play. </li>
            <li><b>Zenysis Hackathon Project</b>: Java software that parses 
                data on maternal mortality rates in Liberia, discovering areas 
                of high mortality, prevalent causes, and providing the data to 
                recommend solutions. </li>
            <li><b>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Project Team</b>: I 
                implemented a vision module in OpenCV that could recognise 
                buoys underwater, and wrote a program that allowed autonomous 
                underwater vehicle to recognise and ram into buoys. </li>
